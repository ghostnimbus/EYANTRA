## About the Eco-Mender Bot Theme 
In an effort to drive efficient and sustainable solutions 🌱, this theme centers around the EcoMender Bot 🤖—a smart, autonomous robot deployed by an industry’s EcoCenter. Triggered by wireless alerts 📶, the bot navigates industrial environments, identifies faulty systems ⚠️, communicates with the central hub 📡, and retrieves tools 🧰 from a depot to carry out essential repairs 🔧.
Powered by a custom RISC-V CPU architecture 🧠 built on an FPGA ⚡, the EcoMender Bot showcases advanced control over sensors and actuators, enabling real-time embedded processing. Participants will gain hands-on experience with Verilog HDL, hardware-software co-design, and VLSI system design, unlocking the potential of parallel processing while contributing to eco-friendly innovation 🌍.


## About My Project

The bot is designed to respond to **wireless alerts** 📶 from the EcoCenter. Once activated, it autonomously navigates through **industrial environments**, swiftly identifying **faulty or inefficient systems** ⚠️. Upon detecting an issue, it communicates the fault information back to the EcoCenter using **Bluetooth UART communication** 📡, and then proceeds to the **resource depot** 🧰 to fetch the necessary tools for **repairs or upgrades** 🔧.

## 🔧 System Architecture

At the heart of the EcoMender Bot lies a **custom-built RISC-V CPU architecture** 🧠, fully implemented on an **FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)** ⚡. The CPU was developed using **Verilog HDL**, tailored for efficient real-time control of the robot’s sensors and actuators.

### 🚀 Key Features:
- **Custom RISC-V CPU** implemented in Verilog HDL
- **Flood Fill Algorithm** with **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** as the base for efficient path planning
- Real-time **embedded processing** on FPGA for sensor-actuator control
- Seamless communication with EcoCenter via **Bluetooth UART**
- Autonomous navigation to **identify, report, and repair** faulty systems

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **FPGA Development Tools**: Xilinx Vivado / Intel Quartus
- **Verilog HDL**: For custom RISC-V processor
- **Bluetooth (UART protocol)**: For communication with EcoCenter
- **Flood Fill + BFS**: For arena traversal and pathfinding
- **VLSI Design Principles**: For efficient hardware resource management
- **Embedded System Integration**: Sensors, actuators, and logic control

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I was able to:
- Design and implement a **RISC-V CPU core** from scratch  
- Leverage **parallel processing** capabilities of FPGAs  
- Develop a robust **path planner** using Flood Fill + BFS  
- Establish reliable **wireless communication** with Bluetooth UART  
- Apply core concepts of **VLSI design**, **hardware-software co-design**, and **embedded systems**
